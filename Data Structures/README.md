# Data Structures
### Allows storing multiple data types in a single collection
- List (Liste)
    - Mutable
    - Ordered
    - Can contain different types of data
    - Nested Lists
- Tuple (Demet)
    - Immutable
    - Ordered
    - Can contain different types of data
    - It is faster
- Set (Küme)
    - Mutable
    - Unordered
    - Unique --> The same element cannot occur twice
    - Mathematical set operations can be performed.
- Frozenset (Değiştirilemez Küme)
    - Immutable
    - Unordered
    - Unique --> The same element cannot occur twice
    - Mathematical set operations can be performed.
- Dictionary (Sözlük)
    - Mutable
    - Anahtar (Key) --> Değer (Value)
    - Unordered
    - Unique --> The same element cannot occur twice
    - Python 3.7 and later preserves the order
- Range (Aralık)
    - It does not take up much space in memory, it only stores the start and end values.
- Byte
    - Immutable
    - It is used in file operations and network programming.
- Bytearray
    - Mutable
    - It is used in file operations and network programming.
